# hangman
GOALS:
Our goal in the project was to create a hangman game and use serialization to be able to save and load a game. 

TAKE AWAY: 
My takeaway is that I need to spend more times researching serialization. I will come back to this assignment to clean up the code once I have a better understanding on how it works.
